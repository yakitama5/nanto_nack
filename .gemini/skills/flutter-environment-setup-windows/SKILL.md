## Goal
Configures a Windows development environment for building Flutter applications targeting Windows Desktop and Android. Analyzes system requirements, modifies environment variables, installs necessary C++ toolchains, manages platform-specific configurations, and generates self-signed certificates for local Windows application deployment. Assumes the host machine is running Windows 10 or 11 with administrative privileges available for system modifications.

## Instructions

1. **Configure Flutter SDK and Environment Variables**
   Extract the Flutter SDK to a secure, user-writable directory (e.g., `C:\develop\flutter`). Do not place it in `C:\Program Files\`.
   Execute the following PowerShell command to append the Flutter `bin` directory to the user's `PATH`:
   ```powershell
   $flutterBinPath = "C:\develop\flutter\bin"
   $currentUserPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
   if ($currentUserPath -notmatch [regex]::Escape($flutterBinPath)) {
       [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$currentUserPath;$flutterBinPath", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
   }
   ```

2. **Install Windows Tooling**
   To compile Windows desktop applications, Visual Studio (not VS Code) is strictly required. Install Visual Studio with the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
   If automating via command line, use the following workload ID:
   ```cmd
   vs_setup.exe --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended
   ```

3. **Decision Logic: Target Platform Configuration**
   **STOP AND ASK THE USER:** "Which target platforms are you configuring for this environment? (A) Windows Desktop, (B) Android, or (C) Both?"
   *   **If (A) Windows Desktop:** Proceed to Step 5. Disable Android and Web if unnecessary:
       ```cmd
       flutter config --no-enable-android
       flutter config --no-enable-web
       flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
       ```
   *   **If (B) Android:** Proceed to Step 4. Disable Windows desktop if unnecessary:
       ```cmd
       flutter config --no-enable-windows-desktop
       ```
   *   **If (C) Both:** Execute Steps 4 and 5. Ensure both platforms are enabled.

4. **Configure Android Tooling on Windows**
   *   Install Android Studio and the Android SDK Command-line Tools via the SDK Manager.
   *   For physical devices: Enable "Developer options" and "USB debugging" on the device. Install the OEM USB drivers for Windows.
   *   For emulators: Enable hardware acceleration in the AVD Manager by selecting a "Hardware" graphics acceleration option under "Emulated Performance".

5. **Build and Package Windows Desktop Applications**
   To compile the Windows application, execute:
   ```cmd
   flutter build windows
   ```
   To package the application manually, gather the following files from `build\windows\runner\Release\`:
   *   The executable (`<project_name>.exe`)
   *   All `.dll` files (e.g., `flutter_windows.dll`)
   *   The `data` directory
   *   Visual C++ redistributables (`msvcp140.dll`, `vcruntime140.dll`, `vcruntime140_1.dll`) placed adjacent to the `.exe`.

   *Optional:* To rename the generated executable, modify the `BINARY_NAME` in `windows/CMakeLists.txt`:
   ```cmake
   # Change this to change the on-disk name of your application.
   set(BINARY_NAME "CustomAppName")
   ```

6. **Generate Self-Signed Certificates for MSIX Packaging (OpenSSL)**
   If the user requires local testing of an MSIX package, generate a `.pfx` certificate. Ensure OpenSSL is in the `PATH`, then execute:
   ```cmd
   openssl genrsa -out mykeyname.key 2048
   openssl req -new -key mykeyname.key -out mycsrname.csr
   openssl x509 -in mycsrname.csr -out mycrtname.crt -req -signkey mykeyname.key -days 10000
   openssl pkcs12 -export -out CERTIFICATE.pfx -inkey mykeyname.key -in mycrtname.crt
   ```
   Instruct the user to install `CERTIFICATE.pfx` into the local machine's Certificate Store under "Trusted Root Certification Authorities".

7. **Validate-and-Fix Feedback Loop**
   Execute the Flutter diagnostic tool to verify the environment:
   ```cmd
   flutter doctor -v
   ```
   *   *Condition:* If `cmdline-tools component is missing` is reported, instruct the user to open Android Studio -> Tools -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools, and check "Android SDK Command-line Tools".
   *   *Condition:* If Visual Studio toolchain issues are reported, verify the `Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop` workload is fully installed.
   *   *Condition:* If `flutter` is not recognized, verify the PowerShell `PATH` injection succeeded and restart the terminal process.

## Constraints
*   Do not include external URLs or hyperlinks in any output.
*   Do not recommend placing the Flutter SDK in directories requiring elevated privileges (e.g., `C:\Program Files\`).
*   Do not confuse Visual Studio Code with Visual Studio; the latter is strictly required for the C++ toolchain on Windows.
*   Always assume the user is operating within a standard Windows command prompt or PowerShell environment unless otherwise specified.
*   Never skip the `flutter doctor` validation step; it is mandatory for confirming environment integrity.
